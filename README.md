Quadratic equation solution calculator.
======================================

This Ruby script calculates the solutions of a Quadratic Equation using parameters passed in as arguments (a,b, and c). A quadratic equation is an algbraic equation in the format of:  

```
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
```

An example quadratic equation is:

```
5x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0
```

For this the solution is: x = −0.2 or x = −1

To run the program:

In a terminal, change to the directory containing the quadratic_sol.rb

Run the script using:

```
./quadratic_sol.rb [arguments]
```

You must supply 3 arguments for a,b and c.

* all values must be integers (i.e. whole numbers - negative of positive)
* the value of 'a' cannot be 0

E.G.

```
./quadratic_sol.rb 5 6 1
```
Please note: Some combinations of values for a,b and c do not have a real solution.
